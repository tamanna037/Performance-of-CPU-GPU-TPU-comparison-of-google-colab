# Performance-of-CPU-GPU-TPU-comparison-of-google-colab

A detailed analysis on Google Colab by comparing the performance of hardware resources on DL model.
To do this, we have chosen image classification application implemented by Convulational Neural Network (CNN) and 
measured the performance of CPU, GPUs and TPUs by varying batch size number of layers and the number of units each layer.
